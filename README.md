# Secure Voting Web App

This is a secure online voting web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and integrated with [FACEIO](https://faceio.net/). The application allows users to register, verify their age, authenticate their identity via facial recognition, and cast their votes on community projects.

## Key Features

- **Age Verification**: Ensure voters meet the age requirement of 18 years and above.
- **Facial Authentication**: Authenticate voters using facial recognition.
- **Anti-Spoofing & Deepfake Prevention**: Prevent fraudulent voting attempts with advanced security measures.

## What is FACEIO?

[FACEIO](https://faceio.net/) is a facial authentication framework that can be implemented on any website with JavaScript to easily authenticate users via face recognition instead of using a login/password or OTP code.
